# Static Page/Site Generator
---

Static Page/Site generator is a project page built using vue, I wanted to learn more about what went into generating static sites.
Most tutorials cover the back-end and using ejs and build scripts to compile a page. I do want to learn about this in the future 
however I though to myself wouldn't it be cool to be able to write small static pages with mark down and beable to use custom markdown
components. 

### Uses 

The Idea was to be able to generate self contained static pages that included html, css, and images all bundled into a neat package.
Users are able to write webpages using predefined templates and markdown. Images must have a cors header to be used currently.

### Built With
 - Vue.js
 - Marked.js
 - Html2canvas
 - Pdf.js 
 - Filesaver.js

### Compatibility
 - Firefox
 - Chrome
 - IE 11^

### Challenges

The hardest part of this project has been dealing with cors and images. Since a lot of websites restrict cors, I am not able to 'add' the image to the webpage as a data url.

### Acknowledgements

- Marked.js for inspiring me.
- Cors for making this a challenge.
- dillinger.io for the inspiration

## Future Plans?

This was a project to learn mainly. However I may implement this at my workplace since I find myself creating tons of static pages.

## Demo? 

I am hosting the project live [here](https://stevendixondev.github.io/static_site_gen/) on my github
